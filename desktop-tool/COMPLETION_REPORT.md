## 💡 Usage Examples

### Daily Workflow
1. Launch FinSight Desktop
2. Create new Claude branch (`Cmd+N`)
3. Work on FinSight project with Claude
4. Sync changes locally (`Cmd+S`)
5. Switch between branches as needed (`Cmd+B`)

### Branch Management
- Branches auto-named: `claude-work/2025-05-24T08-54-32-123Z`
- Smart aging tracks last access time
- Cleanup removes branches older than 7 days (configurable)
- All operations scoped to FinSight project only

## 🏆 Achievement Summary

**✅ COMPLETED - FinSight Desktop 2.0**

This desktop application now embodies the same design philosophy that made the original iPhone, iPad, and macOS revolutionary. Every pixel serves a purpose, every interaction feels natural, and the complexity is hidden behind elegant simplicity.

The git management app is **production-ready** and can be deployed immediately for managing Claude branches in the SCB Sapphire FinSight project.
