# Refined UI Deployment Guide

This document provides instructions for deploying the refined UI system for SCB Sapphire FinSight.

## Overview

The refined UI implementation applies sophisticated design principles:

1. **Visual Cohesion**: Consistent color system, form language, and visual hierarchy
2. **Spatial Economy**: Essential elements with proper spacing and breathing room
3. **Typographic Refinement**: Precise typography with proper hierarchy and readability
4. **Material Expression**: Subtle depth and tactility with shadows and surfaces
5. **Natural Motion**: Physics-based animations for natural interactions
6. **Accessibility**: Support for all users including high contrast and reduced motion
7. **Detail Obsession**: Meticulously aligned components with consistent proportions

## Deployment Process

### Local Testing

1. Run the refined UI deployment script:
   ```bash
   node scripts/enhanced-ui/deploy-refined-ui.js
   ```

2. Start a local server to test:
   ```bash
   cd out
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```

3. Open your browser to `http://localhost:8000` to view the site

### Production Deployment

1. Use the deployment script:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/deploy-refined-ui.sh
   ```

2. Alternatively, deploy manually:
   ```bash
   # Build the refined UI
   node scripts/enhanced-ui/deploy-refined-ui.js
   
   # Deploy to Vercel
   vercel --prod
   ```

## Design System Documentation

The refined UI is built on a comprehensive design system defined in `src/styles/refined-system.css`. This includes:

- **Color System**: Precise RGBA color variables with semantic naming
- **Typography**: Font stack with proper weights and line heights
- **Space & Layout**: Consistent spacing and layout variables
- **Component Styles**: Refined components with proper interaction states
- **Animations**: Natural motion with physics-based animations
- **Accessibility**: Support for high contrast and reduced motion

## File Structure

- `/scripts/enhanced-ui/deploy-refined-ui.js`: Main deployment script
- `/scripts/enhanced-ui/apply-refined-design.js`: Script to apply the design to HTML
- `/src/styles/refined-system.css`: Core design system CSS
- `/scripts/deploy-refined-ui.sh`: Helper script for production deployment

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during deployment:

1. Ensure all required files are present in the `out` directory
2. Check for CSS errors in the console
3. Verify that all assets (images, fonts) are properly loaded
4. Check the Vercel deployment logs for errors
