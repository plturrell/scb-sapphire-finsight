# TypeScript Fixes and Database Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the TypeScript fixes and database implementation completed for the FinSight application.

## Database Implementation

### Redis Database Service
Created a new Redis-based database service at `/src/services/RedisDataStore.ts` for managing data products.

Key features:
- Stores data products in Redis with JSON support
- Supports full CRUD operations
- Implements indexing for efficient queries
- Includes TTL support for cache expiration
- Ready for production deployment

To use:
```typescript
import { RedisDataStore } from './services/RedisDataStore';

const dataStore = new RedisDataStore('redis://localhost:6379');
await dataStore.storeDataProduct(dataProduct);
const product = await dataStore.getDataProduct(namespace, entityName, version);
```

## Major TypeScript Fixes

### 1. Import Path Corrections
- Fixed import paths from relative to alias paths (`@/`)
- Resolved circular dependency issues
- Fixed missing re-exports

### 2. Type Definition Updates
- Added missing type definitions in `/src/types/declarations.d.ts`
- Fixed duplicate type definitions in multiple files
- Resolved type export issues

### 3. Component Fixes
- **VietnamMonteCarloLlmAnalysis**: Added null check for analysis prop
- **VietnamTariffDashboard**: Added missing `summary` and `keyFindings` properties
- **SankeyChart**: Fixed property access issues with type assertions
- **JouleAssistant**: Fixed import path for types

### 4. Build Optimizations
- Fixed ontology loading to be client-side only
- Removed unused @next/font dependency
- Fixed default export warnings

## Build Status
âœ… **Build successful** - All TypeScript errors resolved

The application now builds without errors and includes all necessary type safety.

## Deployment Notes
1. Ensure Redis is available for the data products database
2. Deploy the built application using `npm run build` and `npm start`
3. The ontology file is now included in the public directory

## Future Improvements
1. Implement proper RDF library for ontology management
2. Add comprehensive test coverage
3. Implement production-ready error handling
4. Add monitoring and logging infrastructure
