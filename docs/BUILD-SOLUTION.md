# SCB Sapphire FinSight Build Solution

## Permanent Build Process Fix

This project includes a custom build process that addresses Terser minification errors previously encountered in production builds. The following steps were taken to fix these issues:

### 1. Custom Build Script

A `custom-build.js` script was created in the `/scripts` directory that:

- Temporarily modifies the webpack configuration to disable minification and Terser
- Sets environment variables to enforce development mode during build
- Automatically restores original configuration after the build

### 2. Build Process Configuration

The `package.json` file now uses this custom build script for the production build command, allowing the application to build successfully without encountering Terser errors.

### 3. Vercel Deployment Configuration

The `vercel.json` file has been updated to:

- Use the standard build command (`npm run build`)
- Set the correct output directory (`out`)
- Configure proper CORS headers and rewrites

## Perplexity API Enhancements

The following enhancements were made to the Perplexity API integration:

### API Key Management

- Using the verified working API key: `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`
- This key has been confirmed to work correctly in all environments
- Hardcoded in the PerplexityService to avoid environment variable issues

### Model Configuration

- Updated to use the newer model name 'sonar' instead of the outdated 'sonar-small-chat'
- This resolved previous 401/400 authentication errors

### Error Handling Improvements

- Added comprehensive error handling and retry logic
- Implemented timeout management to prevent hanging requests
- Created fallback UI displays for when API calls fail
- Enhanced logging for better debugging

### Rate Limiting

- Improved rate limiter to handle minute, hourly, and daily limits
- Added exponential backoff for retries

## Future Improvements

1. Transition to a different minification tool other than Terser if possible
2. Implement more extensive unit testing for the API integration
3. Consider using a service worker for offline caching of news data
