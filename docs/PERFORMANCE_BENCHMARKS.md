| JS Bundle Size | 180kb initial, 850kb total |
| Time-to-Interactive | 4.5s on 4G |
| Server Response Time | 200ms median, 500ms p95 |
| Total Block Time | < 300ms |
| Web Vitals | All "Good" thresholds |

## Optimization Strategies

The following strategies were implemented to achieve these benchmarks:

1. **Code Splitting**: Route-based and component-based splitting
2. **Smart Bundle Optimization**:
   - Tree shaking with Webpack
   - Dynamic imports for heavy components
   - Deferred loading of non-critical resources
3. **Image Optimization**:
   - Next.js Image component with proper sizing
   - WebP format with fallbacks
   - Responsive images for different devices
4. **Network-Aware Loading**:
   - Connection-based resource loading
   - Progressive enhancement
   - Offline capability through service worker
5. **Rendering Optimizations**:
   - React.memo for expensive components
   - Virtualized lists for large datasets
   - Deferred rendering for off-screen content

## Measuring Your Build

To measure the current build performance:

```bash
# Analyze bundle sizes
npm run analyze

# Run Lighthouse audit
npm run lighthouse

# Run stress test
npm run stress-test

# Generate performance report
npm run perf-report
```

## Continuous Performance Monitoring

The application includes continuous performance monitoring through:

1. **Real User Monitoring (RUM)**: Captures actual user experiences
2. **Synthetic Monitoring**: Regular checks from different locations
3. **API Performance**: Tracking of all API endpoint performance
4. **Error Rate Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of frontend and backend errors
5. **Resource Usage**: CPU, memory, and network utilization

## Performance Regression Testing

The CI/CD pipeline automatically blocks deploys that:

1. Increase main bundle size by > 10%
2. Degrade any Core Web Vital by > 20%
3. Increase API response times by > 30%
4. Increase memory usage by > 25%
