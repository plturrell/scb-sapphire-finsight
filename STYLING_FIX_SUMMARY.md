# SCB Sapphire FinSight Styling Fix

## Summary of Changes

We've successfully fixed the styling issues in the SCB Sapphire FinSight application by implementing the following changes:

1. **Font Handling**
   - Added proper `@font-face` declarations for SCProsperSans fonts
   - Ensured correct paths and naming conventions for font loading
   - Fixed font-family references throughout the application

2. **CSS Implementation**
   - Created a simplified `combined.css` file with all necessary styles
   - Removed problematic Tailwind directives that were causing build errors
   - Added proper CSS variables for SCB brand colors
   - Implemented component styling classes (fiori-tile, perfect-h1, etc.)

3. **Next.js Configuration**
   - Updated `next.config.js` to handle CSS properly
   - Simplified webpack configuration to avoid CSS loader errors
   - Fixed sourcemap configuration in the build process

4. **Component Styling**
   - Updated `index.tsx` to properly use the new CSS classes
   - Applied fiori-tile and perfect-* typography classes consistently
   - Added animation classes for better UI transitions

5. **Static Deployment**
   - Created a static HTML version with proper styling for demo purposes
   - Implemented a static deployment script for easier sharing
   - Updated vercel.json configuration to handle the new deployment approach
