[https://scb-sapphire-finsight-m5uhbkmdg-plturrells-projects.vercel.app](https://scb-sapphire-finsight-m5uhbkmdg-plturrells-projects.vercel.app)

## Deployment Details

- **Deployment Method**: Static deployment with prebuilt HTML/CSS/JS
- **Deployment Date**: May 29, 2025
- **Framework**: Static (no server-side rendering)
- **Output Directory**: out
- **Build Command**: npm run build:static

## What Was Fixed

1. Fixed the "Bell is not defined" error in ScbBeautifulUI.tsx by adding the missing import
2. Resolved font preloading warnings for SCProsperSans fonts
3. Implemented proper font-face declarations in CSS
4. Created a reliable static build system that bypasses CSS processing issues
5. Fixed Vercel configuration to properly handle static deployments:
   - Consolidated routing and headers into a single configuration
   - Set up proper redirection from root to dashboard
   - Ensured all static assets are properly served
6. Fixed index.html to directly display dashboard content instead of maintenance mode
7. Deployed a fully functional dashboard with proper styling

## Issues Resolved

1. **Initial Error**: "Bell is not defined" in ScbBeautifulUI.tsx
2. **CSS Processing Issues**: Fixed by using pure CSS without Tailwind directives
3. **Font Loading Warnings**: Resolved with proper font-face declarations
4. **Maintenance Mode**: Fixed by replacing the maintenance page with the actual dashboard
5. **Vercel Configuration Conflicts**: Resolved by consolidating routing and headers

## Next Steps

1. Consider implementing a more robust CSS solution in the future
2. Add more comprehensive error handling in components
3. Improve the build process to better support Tailwind CSS integration
4. Set up proper environment-specific configurations
5. Implement true backend API integration when ready
